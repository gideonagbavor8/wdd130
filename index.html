        <p>
            I'm a dedicated Mathematics and IT teacher at the Basic School in Ghana, where I have  been inspiring young minds for over two years. With a Bachelorâ€™s degree in Mathematics and Information and Communication Technology, I combine my passion for teaching with innovative instructional methods. I believe in creating an engaging learning environment that fosters critical thinking and problem-solving skills. My commitment to student success is evident through my involvement in various extracurricular activities, including coding class, math competitions, and Microsoft Office Tools tutoring where I encourage students to explore the world of technology and mathematics beyond the classroom. In addition to teaching roles, I'm an aspiring Software Engineer/Developer, currently enhancing my programming skills through online courses and personal projects. I have a keen interest in developing educational software that can make learning more interactive and accessible for students. With a basic foundation in coding languages like Python, HTML, and CSS. I aim to bridge the gap between education and technology, empowering the next generation of learners to thrive in a digital world. My vision is to inspire students not only to excel in mathematics and IT but also to pursue careers in the tech industry, where they can innovate and create solutions for real-world challenges
